# SpotWx

Queries a gmail account for new messages from a SpotX device.
Replies with a 2-day weather forecast for the device's location.

Location is determined from the email headers
`X-SPOT-Latitude` and `X-SPOT-Longitude`.

Weather is queried from [open-meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs),
and summarized to be less than the SpotX 140 character text limit.
The report will look something like:
```
10/23: Fog | 59/31F | 0.2" (5%) | SE@10mph
10/24: Overcast | 57/35F | 0.0" (1%) | W@35mph
```
On the 23<sup>rd</sup>, the forecast is for Fog with a high of 59 and low of 31ÂºF.
There's a 5% chance of 0.2" precipitation. Winds from the SE at 10 mph.   

A reply email back to the device is sent containing the weather summary.

To be run in the background (i.e. from `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`).
Default polling for new email is every 2 minutes.

## Command Line Args

Command line arguments are of the form `paramName=value`, (no spaces).

loginOnly | boolean | default false
: If true, just connect to GMail and exit. Use from the command line once to pop up a browser for auth and store security tokens in `securityDir`.

pollInterval | long (seconds) | default 120
: Frequency to poll GMail for new mail, in seconds.
To avoid hammering the service if there's an error, first
poll delays for half this time.

securityDir | string (path) | default ./security 
: Where authorization file is stored after initial browser-based authorization.

credentialsFile | string (path) | default ./security/credentials.json
: OAuth2 credentials json file downloaded from google cloud.
See https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/java.

## LaunchDaemon

The plist `com.srednal.spotwx.plist` assumes that the project is at
`/Users/dave/dev/spot-wx/` and java is `/usr/bin/java`.
Fix these if that's not the case.

To install the service:

```
sudo ./load/sh
```

To shut it down:
```
sudo ./unload.sh
```
To see if it's running, check the logs or run `jps`
and look for `spot-wx-1.0-all.jar`.

## Logs

Daily logs for the service are at `./log/spot-wx.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log`
(relative to current working directory).
Should keep logs for 15 days, the be purged.
System out and err from the launch daemon should be empty,
but in any case are sent to
`/Users/dave/dev/spot-wx/log/spotwx-stdout.log` and
`/Users/dave/dev/spot-wx/log/spotwx-stderr.log`.
